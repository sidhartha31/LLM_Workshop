In a strict\\nmathematical method, we should let DV®0 and the sum then becomes\\nan integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,\\nusing Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can\\nbe determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part\\ndiscrete and part continuous.\\n1.13  G AUSS’S LAW\\nAs a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the\\ntotal flux thr ough a spher e of radius r, which encloses a point char ge q\\nat its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in\\nFig. 1.22.\\nThe flux through an area element DS is\\n2\\n0ˆ\\n4q\\nrφεΔ = Δ = ΔπE S r Sii (1.28)\\nwhere we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single\\ncharge q. The unit vector ˆr is along the radius vector from the centre to\\nthe area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is\\nalong the radius vector at that point, the area element DS and ˆr  have\\nthe same direction. Therefore,\\n2\\n04qSrφεΔ = Δπ(1.29)\\nsince the magnitude of a unit vector is 1.\\nThe total flux through the sphere is obtained by adding up flux\\nthrough all the different area elements:FIGURE  1.22  Flux\\nthrough a sphere\\nenclosing a point\\ncharge q at its centre.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n30Physics\\n2\\n04all SqSrφεΔ= Σ Δπ\\nSince each area element of the sphere is at the same\\ndistance r from the charge,\\n2 2\\n0 4 4all Soq qS Sr rφε εΔ= Σ Δ =π π\\nNow S, the total area of the sphere, equals 4 pr2. Thus,\\n2\\n2\\n0 044q qrrφε ε= × π =π(1.30)\\nEquation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of\\nelectrostatics called Gauss’s law.\\nWe state Gauss’s law  without pr oof:\\nElectric flux through a closed surface S\\n= q/ e0(1.31)\\nq = total charge enclosed by S.\\nThe law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is\\nzero if no char ge is enclosed by the sur face. W e can see that explicitly in\\nthe simple situation of Fig. 1.23.\\nHere the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed\\ncylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E . The total\\nflux f  through the surface is  f = f1 + f2 + f3, where f1 and f2 represent\\nthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the\\ncylinder and f3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the\\nclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is\\nperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux,  f3 = 0. Further , the outwar d\\nnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.\\nTherefore,\\nf1 = –E S1,     f2 = +E S2\\nS1 = S2 = S\\nwhere  S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,\\nas expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric\\nflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge\\ncontained in the closed surface is zero.\\nThe great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in\\ngeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let\\nus note some important points regarding this law:\\n(i)Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape\\nor size.\\n(ii)The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the\\nsum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located\\nanywhere inside the surface.\\n(iii)In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some\\ncharges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears\\non the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and\\noutside S. The ter m q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however ,\\nrepresents only the total charge inside S.\\nFIGURE  1.23  Calculation of the\\nflux of uniform electric field\\nthrough the sur face of a cylinder .\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nElectric Charges\\nand Fields\\n31\\n EXAMPLE  1.10(iv)The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called\\nthe Gaussian sur face. Y ou may choose any Gaussian sur face and\\napply Gauss’s law. However , take car e not to let the Gaussian sur face\\npass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due\\nto a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of\\nany charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without\\nany bound.) However , the Gaussian sur face can pass thr ough a\\ncontinuous charge distribution.\\n(v)Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the\\nelectrostatic field when the system has some symmetry.  This is\\nfacilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.\\n(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on\\ndistance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s\\nlaw will indicate departure from the inverse square law.\\nExample 1.10  The electric field components in Fig. 1.24 are\\nEx = ax1/2, Ey = Ez = 0, in which a = 800 N/C m1/2. Calculate (a) the\\nflux through the cube, and (b) the charge within the cube. Assume\\nthat a = 0.1 m.\\nFIGURE  1.24\\nSolution\\n(a)Since the electric field has only an x component, for faces\\nperpendicular to x direction, the angle between E and DS is\\n± p/2. Therefore, the flux  f = E.DS is separately zero for each face\\nof the cube except the two shaded ones. Now the magnitude of\\nthe electric field at the left face is\\nEL = ax1/2 = aa1/2\\n(x = a at the left face).\\nThe magnitude of electric field at the right face is\\nER = a x1/2 = a (2a)1/2\\n(x = 2a at the right face).\\nThe corresponding fluxes are\\nfL= EL.DS = ˆL LSΔE n⋅=EL DS cos q = –EL DS, since q = 180°\\n   = – ELa2\\nfR= ER.DS = ER DS cos q  = ER DS,   since q = 0°\\n   = ERa2\\nNet flux through the cube\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n32Physics\\n EXAMPLE  1.11  EXAMPLE  1.10= fR + fL = ERa2 – ELa2 = a2 (ER – EL) = aa2 [(2a)1/2 – a1/2]\\n=  aa5/2 ()2 –1\\n=  800 (0.1)5/2 ()2 –1\\n= 1.05 N m2 C–1\\n(b) W e can use Gauss’s law to find the total char ge q inside the cube.\\nWe have f = q/ e0 or q = fe0. Ther efore,\\n  q = 1.05 × 8.854 × 10–12 C = 9.27 × 10–12 C.\\nExample 1.11  An electric field is uniform, and in the positive x\\ndirection for positive x, and uniform with the same magnitude but in\\nthe negative x direction for negative x. It is given that E = 200 ˆi  N/C\\nfor x > 0 and E = –200 ˆi N/C for x < 0. A right circular cylinder of\\nlength 20 cm and radius 5 cm has its centre at the origin and its axis\\nalong the x-axis so that one face is at x = +10 cm and the other is at\\nx = –10 cm (Fig. 1.25). (a) What is the net outward flux through each\\nflat face? (b) What is the flux through the side of the cylinder?\\n(c) What is the net outward flux through the cylinder? (d) What is the\\nnet charge inside the cylinder?\\nSolution\\n(a)We can see fr om the figur e that on the left face E and DS are\\nparallel. Therefore, the outward flux is\\nfL= E.DS = – 200 ˆΔi Si\\n=  + 200 DS, since  ˆΔi Si= – DS\\n=  + 200 × p (0.05)2 = + 1.57 N m2 C–1\\nOn the right face, E and DS are parallel and therefore\\nfR =  E.DS =  + 1.57 N m2 C–1.\""

The force is along the line joining the charges.\\n\\nQuestion: What is the relation between electric potential and electric field?\\nHelpful Answer: The electric field is the negative gradient of electric potential. The electric potential at a point is the work done by an external force in bringing a unit positive test charge from infinity to that point. The electric field at a point is the force experienced by a unit positive test charge placed at that point. \\n\\nQuestion: Who discovered the electron?\\nHelpful Answer\"}"
